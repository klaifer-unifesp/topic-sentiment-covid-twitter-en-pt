# Covid-19 message id's, extracted from twitter

This is a dataset containing twitter message id's, which we use to analyze messages related to COVID-19. The messages were collected between April 17,2020 through August 08, 2020, and each dataset has approximately 3M id's.

## Usage

Download and unzip the files. The language can be identified by the substring pt or en in the file name.

We can only share Tweet IDs. You can use these IDs to download the full tweet objects. You can do this using a script like [this](https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/crowdbreaks-paper/blob/master/download_tweets.py).
